(This line specifies the shebang (#!/bin/bash) to indicate that the script should be executed using the Bash shell. The script defines a function named command_exists that checks if a given command is available.)

(This block of code uses a heredoc (<<EOF) to create a docker-compose.yml file for a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP). It defines three services (Nginx, PHP-FPM, and MySQL) and specifies their respective images, ports, and volumes.)

(This code block creates an Nginx configuration file in the nginx/conf.d directory. It configures Nginx to listen on port 80, sets the server name to the provided site name, and defines the PHP-FPM location for processing PHP files.)

(These lines create an index.php file in the php directory with a simple PHP script that outputs PHP information.)

(These lines start the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file using the docker-compose up -d command. It adds an entry to the /etc/hosts file for example.com to resolve to 127.0.0.1. It then opens http://example.com in a web browser using xdg-open.)

(This code block checks if the site containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file are currently running or not. If the containers are running, it stops them using docker-compose stop and displays a message indicating that the site is disabled. If the containers are not running, it starts them using docker-compose start and displays a message indicating that the site is enabled.)
